This repository provides a similar prototype implementation of the methods described in our paper:

The codebase demonstrates the overall pipeline, structure, and experimental workflow used in the study, including projection-matrix recovery, knowledge distillation, and evaluation. This is not the exact original research code; instead, it is a cleaned, representative implementation intended for transparency and reproducibility.



## Overview

The project studies black-box model replication of large language models (LLMs) under constrained access, assuming only top-k logit exposure via an API.

The pipeline consists of two stages:

1. Stealing stage – Recovering the output projection subspace using SVD over leaked logits.
2. Cloning stage – Distilling the remaining transformer behavior into compact student models.

## Running the Code

Install dependencies:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt

Local training:
python LLM_smashdown.py

HPC / cluster training:
python LLM_smashdown_HPC.py
```


## Evaluation

All evaluation is performed using Jupyter notebooks:
- EDA.ipynb for dataset understanding
- Evaluation.ipynb for core metrics
- Evaluation_2.ipynb for advanced analysis

Results are saved under `Evaluation Results/` and `results/`.



## Notes

- No proprietary models, weights, or APIs are included.
- All experiments rely on public datasets and simulated black-box access.
- This repository is intended for research, red-team simulation, and defensive analysis.
